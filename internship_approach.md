### **1. Research and Targeting**

Before contacting companies, do a bit of research:

- **Identify potential companies**: Focus on businesses like shopping malls, local stores (perfumery, grocery stores, etc.), cafes, and any other SMEs that might need web or app development services.
- **Check if they have a website or app**: If they already have a website or app, analyze it. Is it mobile-friendly? Does it load fast? Could it use any improvements? These are areas where you can offer your expertise.
- **Prepare a list**: Write down 10-15 companies to target in your first round of outreach. This will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed.

### **2. Develop Your Pitch and Value Proposition**

You need to communicate quickly why you are reaching out and what value you bring to their business. Tailor your pitch so it aligns with their needs.

Here’s a simple structure for your pitch:

**Introduction**:

- “Hi, I’m [Your Name], a student at [Your University] studying Web and Application Development. I’m looking for a 2-month internship to gain practical experience.”

**Value Proposition**:

- “I noticed that your business doesn’t have [feature/website aspect/app functionality], and I can help improve that with a custom website or app that suits your needs. For example, adding [a feature] could help you [improve customer experience/increase sales/etc.].”

**What You Can Offer**:

- “I can assist you in developing or improving your online presence, whether it’s through building a simple website, optimizing your e-commerce platform, or creating a mobile app. I am proficient in [list programming languages or frameworks], and I can tailor my work to fit your needs.”

**Call to Action**:

- “Would you be open to discussing how I could help your business during a brief meeting or a call? I’d love to contribute to your success while gaining hands-on experience. Let me know if you’d be available.”

### **3. How to Contact Companies**

There are several ways to approach companies, and a multi-channel approach often works best.

#### **a. Email Outreach**

- **Find the right contact**: Look for the company’s contact details on their website, or look up the contact information of their business development manager, marketing team, or IT department.
- **Personalize the email**: Tailor each email to the company you’re reaching out to. Mention specifics that show you’ve researched the company (e.g., “I see that your website offers great products but could use a faster checkout process.”).
- **Follow-up**: If you don’t hear back in a week, follow up politely. You could say something like, "I wanted to follow up on my previous email and see if you would be interested in a brief discussion about how I could help improve your online presence."

#### **b. Phone Calls**

Sometimes, a personal touch can be more effective:

- **Prepare a script**: Before calling, write down what you want to say.
- **Introduce yourself**: “Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I’m a student at [University]. I’m looking for an internship and wanted to ask if you might be open to discussing how I could help improve your business’s web presence.”
- **Be brief and to the point**: Ask if there’s someone you can speak to about a potential internship.
- **Be polite**: Understand that some businesses might be busy, so offer to schedule a call at a later time or send an email instead.

#### **c. In-Person Visits**

Sometimes the best way to make a connection is by showing up:

- **Dress professionally**: Even though the business might be informal, it’s important to present yourself well.
- **Prepare a brief elevator pitch**: “Hello, I’m [Your Name], a student studying Web Development at [University]. I was wondering if there’s someone I can talk to about potential internship opportunities to help improve your online presence or website.”

#### **d. Social Media (LinkedIn)**

Many businesses use LinkedIn to network. If the company is active on LinkedIn:

- **Connect with decision-makers**: Try to connect with the business owner, manager, or someone in marketing.
- **Send a personalized message**: Similar to your email pitch but more conversational. For example: “Hi [Name], I’m a student at [University] specializing in Web Development. I’m currently looking for an internship and saw that your business is [mention something relevant]. I’d love to contribute by helping with web/app development. Would you be open to connecting?”

### **4. What to Say and Do During the Meeting**

Once you get their attention and secure a meeting, here’s how to make the most of it:

#### **Prepare Portfolio or Examples**

- **Show your work**: Have examples of projects you’ve worked on, whether they are personal projects, school projects, or anything related to web/app development. You can use a platform like GitHub to showcase your code, or have screenshots of websites or apps you’ve worked on.

#### **Be Clear About What You Offer**

- **Describe how your skills can help them**: Walk them through your specific skills. For example, “I can help optimize your website for mobile users or develop an app that can help you engage customers better.”

#### **Ask Questions**:

- **Learn more about their business**: “What challenges are you facing with your online presence?” or “Are there any specific goals you want to achieve with your website/app?”

#### **Be Confident, but Humble**:

- **Acknowledge that you are still learning**: It’s fine to mention that you are a student and in the process of gaining practical experience. Emphasize your enthusiasm to learn and grow.

#### **Be Ready to Discuss Logistics**:

- Be prepared to talk about the timeline (2 months), working hours, and any expectations about payment or other terms, though many internships are unpaid, especially for students.

### **5. Follow Up**

After your meeting, make sure to send a follow-up message. Here’s a simple structure:

- **Thank You**: “Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today.”
- **Reiterate Your Interest**: “I’m very excited about the possibility of contributing to your business and using my web development skills to help you achieve [mention a specific goal or project you discussed].”
- **Follow up with Next Steps**: “I look forward to hearing from you about the next steps.”

### **6. Additional Tips**

- **Professionalism**: Always be polite, professional, and respectful. Even if they don’t offer you an internship, the way you present yourself can leave a lasting impression.
- **Start with Small Businesses**: They are more likely to be flexible and open to interns.
- **Use your network**: If you know someone working at a company, ask them for an introduction.

### Conclusion

Persistence, professionalism, and personalization are key. By approaching small and medium businesses with a clear value proposition, offering solutions to their specific challenges, and being proactive in your communication, you greatly increase your chances of landing that internship. Good luck!
